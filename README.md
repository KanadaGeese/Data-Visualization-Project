## Project Documentation

- HTO1, CS01 : Flew containers enable containers rearrangement
- HT02 : ```svg``` or ```div``` : 
    - ```svg``` is a Drawing canvas, used for drawing shapes (here a map)
    - ```div``` is the Generic Box for general purpose (is longer to load)
    - ```svg``` better fits our use
- HT03 : We included the Navigation Bar as it appears on all the website's pages
- HT04 : Basically each sections has information and text or images.
- CS02 : There are two overlay css because we figured that is merged to one. Both icons end in the same place whoch triggers designing issues.
